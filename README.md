# Getting Started

## Reference Documentation
This POC project has been put together following:
* [Implementing a Simple Blockchain in Java](https://www.baeldung.com/java-blockchain)

## To build
mvn clean install

## TODOs
Have a read through tools mentioned in the Baeldung article:
* Solidity: Solidity is a statically-typed and object-oriented programming language designed for writing smart contracts. It can be used to write smart contracts on various blockchain platforms like Ethereum.
  * https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/
* Remix IDE: Remix is a powerful open-source tool to write smart contracts in Solidity. This enables the user to write smart contracts right from the browser.
  * https://remix-project.org/
* Truffle Suite: Truffle provides a bunch of tools to get a developer up and started in developing distributed apps. This includes Truffle, Ganache, and Drizzle.
* Ethlint (formerly Solium): allows developers to ensure that their smart contracts written on Solidity is free from style and security issues. Ethlint also helps in fixing these issues.
* Parity: Parity helps in setting up the development environment for smart contract on Ethereum. It provides a fast and secure way to interact with the blockchain.

Any other/better tools?
